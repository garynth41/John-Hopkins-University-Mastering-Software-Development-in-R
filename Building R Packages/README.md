### Skills Gained
The repo includes the following files:

#### Part 1: Factorial Function

factorial_code.R: R script file that contains four different versions of the Factorial function and that calculates a summary of their performance
factorial_output.txt: text file produced by factorial_code.R that contains the results of the comparison of the four different implementations
#### Part 2: Longitudinal Data Class and Methods

oop_code.R: R script file that contains the code implementing classes, methods, and generics for the longitudinal dataset

oop_output.R: R script that sources oop_code.R and that produces the console output saved in oop_output.txt.

oop_output.txt: a text file containing the console output produced by running oop_output.R. The console output was added manually via copy&paste to the file.
