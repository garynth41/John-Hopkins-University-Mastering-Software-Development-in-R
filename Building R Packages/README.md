For this assignment you'll submit a link to the GitHub repository which contains your package. This assessment will ask reviewers the following questions:

1. Does this package contain the correct R file(s) under the R/ directory?
2. Does this package contain a man/ directory with corresponding documentation files?
3. Does this package contain a vignette which provides a meaningful description of the package and how it should be used?
4. Does this package have at least one test included in the tests/ directory?
5. Does this package have a NAMESPACE file?

7. Is the build of this package passing on Travis?
8. Are the build logs for this package on Travis free of any errors, warnings, or notes?


### Skills Gained
The repo includes the following files:

#### Part 1: Factorial Function

factorial_code.R: R script file that contains four different versions of the Factorial function and that calculates a summary of their performance
factorial_output.txt: text file produced by factorial_code.R that contains the results of the comparison of the four different implementations
#### Part 2: Longitudinal Data Class and Methods

oop_code.R: R script file that contains the code implementing classes, methods, and generics for the longitudinal dataset

oop_output.R: R script that sources oop_code.R and that produces the console output saved in oop_output.txt.

oop_output.txt: a text file containing the console output produced by running oop_output.R. The console output was added manually via copy&paste to the file.
